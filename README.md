# Leveraging Informatics for Promoting Healthy Lifestyle Choices

## Research Question
Our primary research question is: How can digital informatics tools be utilized to enhance lifestyle choices among young adults and working professionals, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases linked to lifestyle?

## Methodology
This project utilizes precision health informatics, involving sophisticated data analytics and customized interventions to enhance health outcomes. Our methodology encompasses:
- Utilizing wearable technology and electronic health records to gather health data.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze big datasets and predict health risks.
- Customizing interventions to encourage physical activity, improved dietary choices, and enhanced stress management skills.

## Findings
Our research highlights that:
- Wearable activity trackers significantly increase daily step count, physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
- Interventions focused on these metrics demonstrate potential reductions in chronic disease risk and healthcare costs.
- Long-term engagement with digital tools promotes sustained healthy habits and well-being.

## Personal Contributions
- Conducted systematic reviews of literature on the effectiveness of digital tools in health promotion.
- Contributed to the data analysis using machine learning techniques to predict health outcomes.
- Assisted in designing and implementing the user interface for the digital wellness app.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the efficacy of informatics in promoting health through targeted, data-driven strategies. It demonstrates significant potential in altering health behaviors and improving life quality, urging further research and application in wider demographics.
